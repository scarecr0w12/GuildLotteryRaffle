=== Version 3.0.621 ===
Released: September 26th, 2018

Hotfix for issue with completing Lottery events.


=== Version 3.0.62 ===
Released: September 24th, 2018

First pass at a system for the mod to check if others in your Guild have this AddOn. If you and others in your Guild have this AddOn, you will be notified if someone has a different version than yours.
If more than one person in your Guild has this AddOn, people in your Guild should now only receive information from the person hosting Events. This only affects players who type "!lottery" or "!raffle" into the Guild chat channel. In the event that more than one person are hosting Events, then people will receive information from anyone hosting.
New variable for your Custom Guild Alerts: %version will now return the current version of the AddOn.
Did some QoL to the Custom Guild Alert system: Leaving a message blank will prevent it from being sent.
You can now inverse the announcement order for Raffle Winners. This is done in the Raffle settings under the Events Configuration menu.


=== Version 3.0.61 ===
Released: September 20th, 2018

When updating to this version, you will need to restart WoW before you can run the Draw for your Events.
Fix for the Custom Message Preview tab in the Configuration Menu. Also did some QoL to the Custom Messages, you will no longer be able to use %raffle variables in the Custom Lottery message tab (and vice versa). The only exception is the tab for both Lottery & Raffle Custom Messages.
New variable for the Custom Lottery Message tab - %lottery_tickets will now return the amount of tickets sold (does not include tickets given away).
The entire Event Draw system has been localized (you will no longer be able to do a /run script to trigger it).


=== Version 3.0.6 ===
Released: September 19th, 2018

New Feature! You can now customize the Alert Guild messages. This is done in the Messages tab of the Configuration menu. Several variables have been provided, such as %lottery_price will return the cost of your Lottery Tickets. You can also copy existing Message Profiles from your other characters. This is done under the Profiles tab of the Configuration menu.


=== Version 3.0.53 ===
Released: September 16th, 2018

Fix for issue with players that have other AddOns installed which would prevent people from receiving event information. You will now have to use '!lottery' or '!raffle' to receive the respective event information.
Changed the Alert Guild system so the messages sent will be shown in order (was shown out of order sometimes if you have certain AddOns installed).


=== Version 3.0.52 ===
Released: September 11th, 2018

Final hotfix to the Alert Guild system (apparently v3.0.51 didn't completely fix it).


=== Version 3.0.51 ===
Released: September 11th, 2018

Hotfix for issue with the Alert Guild system.


=== Version 3.0.5 ===
Released: September 11th, 2018

The AddOn's saved data structure has been completely reworked to allow for a more fluid setup. When creating Raffles, the AddOn will now detect whether a item you've entered (by shift+clicking) is Soulbound and remove it. This applies even if you have the 'Allow Invalid Items' box checked.


=== Version 3.0.4 ===
Released: August 13th, 2018

New Feature! You can now create Lottery & Raffle profiles. The AddOn will use these settings to remember things such as Ticket Price for all future events. You can change these whenever you like, you can also copy existing profiles from your other characters.
New Feature! You can now give tickets to all Guild Members at once! Doing so will not increase the current Jackpot.
Fixed bug with the AddOn not correctly messaging players that haven't received their ticket information upon logging in. The Multi-Guild Roster for Multi-Guild Events is now updated upon logging in and no longer requires a reload to save. If you have 'Multi-Guild Events' and 'Toggle Chat Info' enabled, you will now receive a message once the roster has been updated.
The AddOn has been translated to French, but until I've fixed the scaling issue it presents it's been disabled. You may enable it by changing the Locales.xml file.


=== Version 3.0.3 ===
Released: August 4th, 2018

New Feature! You can now create Lottery & Raffle Events for multiple guilds. To do this, you must log on to each character that's in a different guild and enable the 'Multi-Guild Events' option. If your guilds span both factions you also have the option to enable Cross-Faction events, unlike the Multi-Guild setting, this option only needs to be set on the character hosting the event. If hosting a Multi-Guild Event the person receiving ticket information will have to be higher than level 20 (unless they whisper you 'lottery' or 'raffle', or do the same in Guild chat). This is a limitation brought on by the /who system.
New Feature! You can now increase the current Lottery Jackpot without selling new tickets. Doing so will alert your guild of the change.
Did some quality of life changes to the AddOn's loading process. Won't have to do a reload on new characters for setting changes to take effect now, now you can simply log in make your changes and log out.


=== Version 3.0.2 ===
Released: July 21st, 2018

With Communities enabled, the mod now has the ability to create Guild Announcements in the Calendar for your events. To enable this feature, check the 'Create Calendar Events' box in the Config menu.


=== Version 3.0.1 ===
Released: July 18th, 2018

With Communities temporarily disabled, the ability to create Guild Events was also removed. Should have another update, allowing the mod to create Guild Events for your Lottery & Raffles, once Communities has been enabled.
Did some minor bug fixes with the Mail Scanning feature. It wouldn't correctly enter information for the mod to later use to message the player about their ticket information.
Changed the way the mod handles whispering players information about any Lottery or Raffle events, character level will no longer be a issue.
